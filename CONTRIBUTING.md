# Contributing to Vext

First off, thanks for taking the time to contribute! 🎉

The following is a set of guidelines for contributing to Vext. These are mostly guidelines, not rules. Use your best judgment, and feel free to propose changes to this document in a pull request.

## 🛠️ Project Architecture

Vext is a monorepo managed with **Bun Workspaces**.

- **apps/frontend**: Desktop application built with **Tauri** + **Vue 3**.
- **apps/backend**: Main REST API built with **Elysia.js**.
- **apps/server**: WebSocket server for real-time features.
- **packages/database**: Shared MongoDB schemas and connection logic.
- **infra**: Docker configurations for local development.

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- **Docker Desktop** (running)
- **Bun** (latest version)
- **Rust** (for Tauri frontend)

### Setup

1.  **Clone the repository**

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/vext.git
    cd vext
    ```

2.  **Install Dependencies**

    ```bash
    bun install
    ```

3.  **Environment Variables**
    Copy `.env.example` to `.env` in `apps/frontend`, `apps/backend`, and root if necessary.

4.  **Start Development**
    - **Frontend (Default)**:
      Connects to the remote Render backend. Perfect for UI/UX work.

      ```bash
      cd apps/frontend && bun run tauri dev
      ```

    - **Backend / Full Stack**:
      Required only if you are modifying the API or Database schemas.

      ```bash
      # Start Infrastructure
      docker-compose -f docker-compose.infra.yml up -d

      # Start Services
      cd apps/backend && bun run dev
      cd apps/server && bun run dev
      ```
